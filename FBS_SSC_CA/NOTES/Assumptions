The classical models have all materials associated to the same blade class - HT3_BLADE_1.
and it has 4 memory kits, each with domain of 2,4,8,16 GB - giving each blade 16*4=64GB max memory
thi sis contrary to the Vtable data, for example 'BL460CG7' having min 6 GB and Max 600 GB of RAM.

So i will make this simplifying assumption -
the BL460CG7 is a blade server - containing n blades (HT3_BLADE_1).  
to get min memory (6GB) - n=1 with 3 mem kits of 2 gb each 
to get max memory (600) - n=10; 9 with 4 kits of 16 (9*64=576), and 1 with 3 kits of 8 (24).
So i will leave my classes intact, but instead of specializing to the classical material (HT3_), 
specialize to my Adv Mode Material (SOL_) with a Bom, position 10 is the classical Material)
the calssical materials will have the cstics of BLade_1
I will set values ad instantiate as many as are needed.

Discuss with Eberhard Schick, and with Steve.
because even when done with this, it doesnt seem right that wewould need 10+ distinct materials and KB's 
when they are all identical.
